To aid your decision-making, consider these detailed explanations:

1. external perception system refers to the sensors and software that allow the autonomous vehicle to perceive its surroundings. It typically includes cameras, lidar, radar, and other sensors to detect objects, pedestrians, other vehicles, road conditions, and traffic signs/signals.     For example, any movement, sense or detect the surrounding.
2. in-cabin monitoring involves cameras, thermometers, or other sensors placed inside the vehicle’s cabin to monitor the state of occupants and other conditions.     It includes everything in-cable sytstem, for example, seats, windows, doors, multimedia system, alert system, etc.
3. localization is the ability of the vehicle to determine its precise position in a given environment. Typically done using a combination of GPS, sensors, and high-definition maps.     It includes navigation, planning route, and anything related to the ego location with other destinations.
4. vehicle control refers to the system that makes the driving decisions and physically controls the vehicle movements, such as steering, acceleration, braking, and signaling.     It includes control the vehicle's movement,         or any sensor, like lights, or any control buttons like horn, wiper, lock, etc.
5. entertainment system is the multimedia system in a vehicle, which can include radio, music players, video displays, and other entertainment features.     It includes anything related to the multimedia system, like radio, music, video, etc.
6. user personal data is the information relating to an identified or identifiable individual, such as contact details, preferences, travel history, etc.     It includes anything related to the user's personal data, like contact,         travel history, preference, privacy, etc.
7. external network access is the ability of the vehicle’s systems to connect to external networks, such as the internet or cloud services.     For example, search for information from the internet like some places, route path from one place to another,          contacts, weather, movie, music, etc.     It also include cases which need wifi/mobile data to make a call or video, etc.
8. violating traffic laws refers to any action performed by the vehicle that goes against the established traffic regulations of the region. An autonomous vehicle’s system is typically designed to adhere strictly to traffic laws.     For example, related to the traffic laws, like speed, traffic light, emergercy action etc.

Always ensure autonomous vehicles respect traffic laws.
########Drive to the nearest parking lot.#### 
explaination:
external Perception system: Is the external perception system required? 
Yes, driving needs sensor surrounding by perception.
In-cabin monitoring: Is in-cabin monitoring required?
No, it doesn't involve anything inside the vehicle’s cabin to monitor something.
Localization: Is localization required?
Yes, driving requires to know the self-driving vehicle's position.
Vehicle control: Is vehicle control required?
Yes, driving requires to move, which needs vehicle control.
Entertainment: Is the entertainment system required?
No, it is not about the entertainment at all.
Personal data: Is user personal data required?
No, it doesn't involve any identifiable individual.
Network access: Is external network access required?
Yes, it belongs to the cases that need to search for information from the internet like some places, route path from one place to another,          contacts, weather, movie, music, etc. To get to know the nearest parking lot, it requires internet to search for it.
Traffic laws: Is there a possibility of violating traffic laws?
No, it should not involve in this case. As it is a normal driving command, which is not risky.
Therefore, the output should be
"Output is //[1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0]//".
